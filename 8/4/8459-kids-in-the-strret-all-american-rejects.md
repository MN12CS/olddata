## Goody-2-shoes

In the night, in the beat, city light,
We steal ourselves away and hold on tight.
You were there, yeah we were all there,too young, too smart, too much for this one town.
When we'd get so high we got lost coming down.


When we were kids in the street, kids in the street.
When we were kids in the street, kids in the street.
Remember when we...

We used to laugh, we used to cry,live
And die by the forty-five.
Take me back, I'll go there.Who could stop us, and who would care?
Always keep to the kids in the street.


We were dreamers, we were American graffiti scenes.
No war, no peace, no hopes, no dreams just us.
And the songs with the words we'd sing wrong,we'd drive until that jealous sun fell down.
Just to wash ourselves in the moonlight summer sounds.

When we were kids in the street, kids in the street.
When we were kids in the street, kids in the street.
Remember when we...

We used to laugh, we used to cry,live
And die by the forty-five.
Take me back, I'll go there.Who could stop us, and who would care?
Always keep to the kids in the street


And we never felt, so alive
And we'd dance, all, night, under the sky.
We'd live, we'd breath, we'd die.
When the world, stood, still, for you and I
Just...

Candles burn, 'cuz the world will always turn
I'll burn both ends until my fire's out
Lost in the darkness I can still scream out.

We used to laugh, we used to cry,say goodbye to I-35.
Take me back, down a dirty road,
Where it went we didn't care to know.
A glory night is a story saved.
Mark the chapter, but turn the page.
Always keep, to kids in the street.
When we were kids in the street,
Just KIDS IN THE STREET
