Ha, haa
Ha, haa


The real me is a southern girl with her Levi's on and an open heart
Wish I could save the world, like I was super girl
Real me is to laugh all night lyin' in the grass just talkin' about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated


I'm still thinkin' about it, almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
With you


I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you, with you, with you
Now that I'm with you


You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowin' you found me


'Cuz I'm still thinkin' about it, I almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cuz with you


I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothin' but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you, with you, with you


Come and take me
Love you save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself
With you


With you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you


I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you
