​English version 
Through delusions of “how you want things to be” vs. reality, 
Keep stirring the pot, building your individuality. 
Deleting yet another, Of the problems you’ve been troubled by, 
Taking things from beginning to end: 
That’s my life’s entertainment! 
Boom, boom, boom, dancing through the skies 
We aren’t dead yet, 
And the future we’ve unraveled…! 
Boom, boom, boom, dancing through the skies 
Kick up the Earth, And take it even higher! 
Everybody, put your hands up; 
Yeah, flyin’ – let them be your wings! I’d like to see, 
You deep in this trance; 
Our period of growth has come… heading for a new world! 
Everybody, put your hands up; 
Yeah, flyin': Imagine it like that! 
You can surely become, 
Who you want to be, 
So search out that grand stage, 
Where “you’re the one”! 
(Flyin’) Within the memories, 
(Flyin’) You’d forgotten,
Listen to that rising beat in your chest, 
Once again!
