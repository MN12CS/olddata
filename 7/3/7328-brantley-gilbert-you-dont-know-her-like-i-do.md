Lyrics:

 Hey ole Friend, thanks for callin'
It's good to know somebody cares
Now she's gone, but I don't feel like talkin'
Might be just too much to bear
To hear somebody say I'll stop hurting
To hear somebody say she ain't worth it

You don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do

I can't forget, or drink away these memories
It hurts my soul, cause it won't pass
And I can't go, it's like a death inside the family
It's like she stole my way to breathe
Don't try to tell me I'll stop hurting
Don't try to tell me she ain't worth it

You don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do

You don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend
There's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do
