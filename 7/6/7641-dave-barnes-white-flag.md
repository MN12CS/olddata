I know I know I know I’ve hurt you lately
You and I, drew this battle line
We’d go we’d go we’d go from good to guns blazing
I’m the one to blame, I just wanna say

(Oh oh oh) I’m sorry
(Oh oh oh) Forgive me
Just let me back inside your arms girl
(Oh oh oh) Forgive me
(Oh oh oh) I’m sorry
This ain't the way our love should go

I got my white flag wavin'
In the midnight it's alright
(I'm never gonna let you go
Never ever gonna let you go)
[x2]

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

We know we know we know life comes in stages
We crash and burn, but that's how we learn
If so if so if so these scars will make us
Better by the day, I just wanna say

(Oh oh oh) I’m sorry
(Oh oh oh) Forgive me
Just let me back inside your arms girl
(Oh oh oh) Forgive me
(Oh oh oh) I’m sorry
This ain't the way our love should go

I got my white flag wavin'
In the midnight it's alright
(I'm never gonna let you go
Never ever gonna let you go)
[x2]

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Girl don't you know that I dream about you
Won't let you get away

Forgiveness is the chorus
Of a rebel song
And we belong (we belong...)

I got my white flag wavin'
At midnight it's alright
(We belong...)

I got my white flag wavin'
At midnight it's alright
(I'm never gonna let you go
Never ever gonna let you go)
[x2]

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Girl don't you know that I dream about you
Won't let you get away
