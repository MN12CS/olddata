Twisted this feeling walked out of shape 
So tired of revealing the moves that I make
And I know, yes I know, but is this real? 
And I know, yes I know, but is this real?
Feeling inconstant could drive me insane
Flesh to blood to bone to love
Twisted.

And I know, yes I know, but is this real? 
And I know, yes I know, but is this real? 

Is this real?

Twisted this feeling
Flesh, blood, bone, love
Twisted
Twisted this feeling

And I know, yes I know, but is this real? 
And I know, yes I know, but is this real? 

Flesh to blood to bone my love
Twisted
Twisted

Is this real?
