What You Can Change and What You Can’t: The Complete Guide to Successful Self-Improvement – Martin E. Seligman

​
n the climate of self-improvement that pervades our culture, there is an  overwhelming amount of information about treatments for everything from  alcohol abuse to sexual dysfunction. Much of this information is  exaggerated if not wholly inaccurate. As a result, people who try to  change their own troubling conditions often experience the frustration  of mixed success, success followed by a relapse, or outright failure.
To address this confusion, Martin Seligman has meticulously analyzed the  most authoritative scientific research on treatments for alcoholism,  anxiety, weight loss, anger, depression, and a range of phobias and  obsessions to discover what is the most effective way to address each  condition. He frankly reports what does not work, and pinpoints the  techniques and therapies that work best for each condition, discussing  why they work and how you can use them to make long lasting change.  Inside you’ll discover the four natural healing factors for recovering  from alcoholism; the vital difference between overeating and being  overweight; the four therapies that work for depression, the pros and  cons of anger–and much more.
