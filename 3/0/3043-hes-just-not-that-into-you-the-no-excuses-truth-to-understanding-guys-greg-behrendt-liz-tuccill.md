## He's Just Not That Into You: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys - Greg Behrendt; Liz Tuccill

## Hee_bum

This is my favorite book. U can read the signs of men which mean: "I'm just not that into you" Besides, just read it, not everything in this book is believable althought it's written by a man 

An excuse is an polite rejection. Men are not afraid of RUINING THE FRIENDSHIP
Dont get tricked into asking him out. If he likes you, he'll do the asking
If you can find him, then he can find you. If he wants to find u, he will
Just because you lke to lead doesn't mean he wants to dance. Some traditions are born of nature and last through time 4 a reason
"hey, let's meet at so-and-so's party/anybar/friend's house" is not a date. Even if you live in NY
Men dont forget how much they like you. So put down the phone.
You are good enough to be asked out
If he's not calling you, it's because you re not in his mind
If he creats expectations 4 u, and then doesnt follow through on little things, he'll do the same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he's ok with disappointing you
Dont be with someone who doesnt do what they say they're going to do
If he's choosing not to  make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to recurring fight, then he doesnt respect ur fellings and needs
BUSY is another word for ASSHOLE. ASSHOLE is another word for a guy you're dating
You deserve a fucking phone call
If you dont know where the relationship is going, it's ok to pull over and ask
There's a guy out there who will want to tell everyone that he's ur BF. Quit goofing around and go find him
CHEATING IS CHEATING. It doesnt matter whom it was with or how many times is happened
CHEATERS never prosper
He doesnt need to be reminded that you're great
There's a guy out there who's going to be really happy that you didnt get back together with ur crappy ex-BF
