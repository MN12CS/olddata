Well I wonder could it be 
When I was dreaming 'bout you baby 
You were dreaming of me 
Call me crazy, call me blind 
To still be suffering is stupid after all of this time 

PRE-CHORUS 1 
Did I lose my love to someone better 
And does she love you like I do 
I do, you know I really really do 

CHORUS 
Well hey 
So much I need to say 
Been lonely since the day 
The day you went away 
So sad but true 
For me there's only you 
Been crying since the day 
The day you went away 

VERSE 2 
I remember date and time 
September twenty second 
Sunday twenty five after nine 
In the doorway with your case 
No longer shouting at each other 
There were tears on our faces 

PRE-CHORUS 2 
And we were letting go of something special 
Something we'll never have again 
I know, I guess I really really know 

CHORUS 
The day you went away 
The day you went away 

BRIDGE 
Why do we never know what we've got 'til it's gone 
How could I carry on 
The day you went away 
Cause I've been missing you so much I have to say 
Been crying since the day 
The day you went away 

The day you went away 
The day you went away
