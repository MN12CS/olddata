Same Changes Lyrics:

Arms around my body
Kisses on my skin
I walk away
I walk away
But he lingers

Maybe it should matter
More to be myself
I walk away
I walk away
But he lingers

And everyone says
This love will change you
Well I ask, does anything ever stay the same
No, no, no
Just same changes

Ooh (changes, the same)
Ooh (changes, the same)

In the magic hour
Lantern petals glow
I walk away
I walk away
But you linger

Light as any flower
You don't even know
You pick me up
You pick me up
With two fingers

And everyone says
This love will change you
Well I ask, does anything ever stay the same
No, no, no
Just same changes

Ooh (changes, the same)
Ooh (changes, the same)

Every day I want to freeze frame
Scrambling my sleep to keep this fragile frame
From the wind, from the driving rain
Soon as it begins it begins to change it's strange changes

Ooh (changes, the same)
Ooh (changes, the same)

Careful and with patience
Hold this tender heart
Leave a well of tiny threads with two fingers
Standing in the garden
Gathering the dusk
We hold the sun and golden one and we linger

And everyone says
This love will change you
Well I ask, isn't that what love's supposed to do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's same changes

Ooh (changes, the same)
Ooh (changes, the same)
Ooh (changes, the same)
Ooh (changes, the same)
