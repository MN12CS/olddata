When hope was high...
And life worth living...

Stronger - Kelly Clarkson

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

Written in the stars - Tinie Tempah
Written in the stars...
A million miles away...
A message to the main...
Seasons come and go...
But I will never change...
And I’m on my way...

The climb - Miley Cyrus
