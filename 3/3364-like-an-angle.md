## Like an angle

## Hee_bum

I'm waiting here for that someone
 everyday and night. 
Needing someone to hold me tight.
 To cheer me up when I'm sad. 
And make me smile when I'm mad.
 I need that someone that will always care. 
someone that will always be ther.
 Even when I'm right or wrong.
And always there to keep me strong.
 Someone to show me that there is no fear.
Someone always there and always near.
 Always helping me to get me through.
Someone there to say I LOVE YOU. 
 someone to be there when I'm cold.
And always there for me to hold.
 Someone there for me to think of.
Someone there to show me LOVE ~ â€‹
