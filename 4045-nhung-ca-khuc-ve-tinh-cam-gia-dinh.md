Father and son - Boyzone

Father:
It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy


I was once like you are now
and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

Son:
How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again

It's always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

Father:
I was once like you are now
and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on

But take your time, think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

Son:
All the times that I cried
keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
If they were right, I'd agree

but it's them THEY know not me
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go



Butterfly fly away - Miley Cyrus

You tuck me in, 
Turn out the light 
kept me safe and sound at night 
little girls depend on things like that 

Brush my teeth and comp my hair 
had to drive me everywhere 
you were always there when I looked back 


You had to do it all alone 
Make a living, make a home 
Must have been as hard as it could be 

And when I couldn't sleep at night 
Scare things wouldn't turn out right 
you would hold my hand and sing to me 

Caterpillar in the tree, how you wonder who you'll be 

can't go far but you can always dream 
Wish you may and wish you might 
don't you worry hold on tight. 
I promise you there will come a day 
Butterfly Fly Away 
Butterfly Fly Away (butterfly fly away) 

Flap your wing now you cant stay 
Take those dreams and make them all come true 

Butterfly Fly Away (butterfly fly away) 
We been waiting for this day 
All along and know just what to do 
Butterfly, 
Butterfly, 
Butterfly, 
Butterfly Fly Away 

(Butterfly Fly Away)

We dreamed a dream
Woke up and lived it
We had the music in our hands

The drops of rain
Became a river
And now it's time to end these things
So "Thank you"

My mamma said that the best thing in life was getting me alive
Somebody hadn't anything else in this world, baby
My mamma said she would give her life up for me

My mamma said
My mamma said
My ma-ma-mamma

My mamma said that the worse thing in life was getting used to love
Somebody hadn't anything else in this world, baby
No you ain't going to, no you ain't going to lose it all

Mamma don't leave
Don't go
Don't run
Don't hide
Don't cry
Don't ever feel scared now

Mamma just crossed
Just crossed
To the parallel world
She crossed
She crossed
To the multiverse

Circle and protons, all vibrations
Circle and neutrons, all vibrations

Mamma just crossed
Just crossed
To the parallel world
She crossed
She crossed
To the multiverse

I know you're lying dear
Taking your last breath
I'm holding back the tears
Oh mamma don't die

My mamma said that the best thing in life was getting me alive
Somebody hadn't anything else in this world, baby
My mamma said she would give her life up for me

My mamma said
My mamma said
My ma-ma-mamma

My mamma said that the worse thing in life was getting used to love
Somebody hadn't anything else in this world, baby
No you ain't going to, no you ain't going to lose it all

My mamma said, my mamma said
My mamma said, my mamma said

Mamma, hold on
Give in
Let go
Release yourself
From everything
Now dear

Mamma just crossed
Just crossed
To the parallel world
She crossed
She crossed
To the multiverse

Circle and electrons, all vibrations
Circle and electrons, all vibrations

Mamma just crossed
Just crossed
To the parallel world
She crossed
She crossed
To the multiverse

I know you're lying dear
Taking your last breath
I'm holding back the tears
Oh mamma don't die

My mamma said that the best thing in life was getting me alive
Somebody hadn't anything else in this world, baby
My mamma said she would give her life up for me

My mamma said
My mamma said
My ma-ma-mamma

Papa - Paul Anka

[video=youtube;3MTL7OMfFro]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MTL7OMfFro[/video]

Everyday my papa worked
To help to make ends meet
To see that we would eat
(To) keep those shoes upon my feet
Every night my papa would take
And tuck me in my bed
Kiss me on my head
After all my prayers were said

Growing up with him was easy
time just flew on by
The years began to fly
He aged and so did I

I could tell
That mama wasn't well
Papa knew and deep down so did she
So did she
When she died
My papa broke down and cried
All he said was, "God, Why not take me!"

Every night he sat there sleeping in his rocking chair
He never went upstairs
All because she wasn't there

Then one day my Papa said,
"Son, I'm proud (of) the way you've grown
make it on your own
I'll be O.K. alone."

Every time I kiss my children
Papa's words ring true
"Your children live through you.
They'll grow and leave you, too"
I remember every word my papa used to say
I live that every day
He taught me well that way

Every night my papa would take
And tuck me in my bed
Kiss me on my head
After all my prayers were said

Every night my papa would take
And tuck me in my bed
Tuck me in my bed
After all my prayers were said

Mama - Spice Girls

She used to be my only enemy and never let me free, 
Catching me in places that I know I shouldn't be, 
Every other day I crossed the line,
I didn't mean to be so bad,
I never thought you would 
Become the friend I never had

Back then I didn't know why, 
Why you were misunderstood, 
So now I see through your eyes, 
all that you did was love,

Mama I love you, Mama I care,
Mama I love you, Mama my friend,
My friend 

I didn't want to hear it then but 
I'm not ashamed to say it now, 
Every little thing you said and did was right for me,
I had a lot of time to think about,
About the way I used to be,
Never had a sense of my responsibility. 

Back then I didn't know why,
Why you were misunderstood,
So now I see through your eyes,
All that you did was love,
Mama I love you, Mama I care,
Mama I love you, Mama my friend, My friend 

But now I'm sure I know why, 
Why you were misunderstood, 
So now I see through your eyes,
All I can give you is love,
Mama I love you, Mama I care,
Mama I love you, Mama my friend,
My friend 

Mama I love you, Mama I care,
Mama I love you, Mama my friend,
You're my friend

Thanks for listening
