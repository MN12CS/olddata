Darling, I hate to see you so angry with the world
If people want a piece of you
Then they're missing something for themselves .
Maybe it's selfish of me to look at you an say
"Come back to me girl I love and I'll stay"

Cause I love your smile
Yes I love your smile
How I love your smile
More than you know.

Sometimes I might seem cold holding nack my sympathies
For people stories people tell
Can so easily be believed ;
The truth gets so distorted when everyone knows best
And sadness tends to find his friends
On the road to righteousness -

Darling, let's never be a part of that

Cause I love your smile
Yes I love your smile
How I love your smile
More than you know.

I don't know why a laugh is hard to find 

Could it be all of your fears that we hide behind ?
Like bricks in the wall I wanna see them fall down !

Cause I love your smile
Yes I love your smile
How I love your smile
More than you know.
