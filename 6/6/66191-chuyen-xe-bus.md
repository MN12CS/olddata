Song: Wait on me
Singer: Rixton
Lyrics:
Wait on me
I know how to love you
I don't want to love you so more
Wait on me
Come a little closer
Want to be the one to explore
A little trouble never hurt nobody
Ooh I want to feel your body
Wait on me
I know how to love you
I don't want to love you so more
Take it, take it
I'll get my heart to you for free
Don't you break it, break it
Along with every piece of me
I'll hold the distance but not all of the way
Say what you mean to me, and mean what you say, yeah
I never wanna your ex-man
I'll never make you feel ignored
You can go and find your next man
But I know what you waiting for
Wait on me
I know how to love you
I don't want to love you so more
Wait on me
Come a little closer
Want to be the one to explore
A little trouble never hurt nobody
Ooh I want to feel your body
Wait on me
I know how to love you
I don't want to love you so more
So more, oh, oh
So more, oh, oh
Say it, say it
I know there's something on your mind, girl
And I hate it, hate it
When you just say like you're okay, yeah
I wanna be the one and all that you need
I listen to your heart, I know how it speaks
I never wanna your ex-man
I'll never make you feel ignored
You can go and find your next man
But I know what you waiting for
Wait on me
I know how to love you
I don't want to love you so more
Wait on me
Come a little closer
Want to be the one to explore
A little trouble never hurt nobody
Ooh I want to feel your body
Wait on me
I know how to love you
I don't want to love you so more
So more, oh, oh
So more, oh, oh
I wanna love you so more
Come closer
You know ya, don't feel like before
I'll give you what you want till you want it more
In your head, in your heart, like never before
If a good thing is what you waiting for
Then don't you look no more
Wait on me
I know how to love you
I don't want to love you so more
Wait on me
Come a little closer
Want to be the one to explore
A little trouble never hurt nobody
Ooh I want to feel your body
Wait on me
I know how to love you
I don't want to love you so more
So more, oh, oh
So more, oh, oh​
