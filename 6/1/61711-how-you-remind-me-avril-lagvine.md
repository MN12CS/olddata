â€‹Never made is as a wise man.
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing.
Tired of living like a blind man.
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling.
This is how you remind me.
This is how you remind me.
Of what I really am.
It's not like you to say sorry.
I was waiting on a different story.
This time I'm mistaken.
For handing you a heart worth breaking.
And I've been wrong, I've been down.
And to the bottom of every bottle.
These five words in my head.
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?".
"Are we having fun yet?".
Oh oh oh oh.
It's not like you didn't know that.
I said I love you and I swear I still do.
It must have been so bad.
'Cause living with me must have damn near killer you.
This is how you remind me(You remind me).
This is how you remind me.
Of what I really am.
It's not like you to say sorry.
I was waiting on a different story.
This time I'm mistaken.
For handing you a heart worth breaking.
And I've been wrong, I've been down.
And to the bottom of every bottle.
These five words in my head.
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?".
Oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
This is how you remind me(You remind me).
This is how you remind me.
Of what I really am.
It's not like you to say sorry.
I was waiting on a different story.
This time I'm mistaken.
For handing you a heart worth breaking.
And I've been wrong, I've been down.
And to the bottom of every bottle.
These five words in my head.
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?".
"Are we having fun yet?".
Are we having fun yet.
Oh oh oh oh oh.
