â€‹All I need's a little love in my life.
All I need's a little love in the dark.
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start.
Me and my broken heart.
I need a little loving tonight.
Hold me so I'm not falling apart.
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start.
Me and my broken heart, yeah.
Shot gun, aimed at my heart, you got one.
Tear me apart and then some.
How do we call this love? Oh oh oh oh.
I try to run away but your eyes.
Tell me to stay, oh why-y.
Why do we call this love? Oh oh oh oh.
It seems like we've been losing control.
Somebody tell me I'm not alone.
When I say:
All I need's a little love in my life.
All I need's a little love in the dark.
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start.
Me and my broken heart.
I need a little loving tonight.
Hold me so I'm not falling apart.
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start.
Me and my broken heart, yeah.
Uh, maybe some part of you just hates me.
You pick me up and play me.
How do we call this love? Oh oh oh oh.
One time tell me you need me tonight.
To make it easy, you lie.
And say it's all for love? Oh oh oh oh.
It seems like we've been losing control.
Somebody tell me I'm not alone.
When I say:
All I need's a little love in my life.
All I need's a little love in the dark.
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start.
Me and my broken heart.
I need a little loving tonight.
Hold me so I'm not falling apart.
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start.
Me and my broken heart.
Whoa oh, whoa oh.
Me and my broken heart.
Whoa oh, whoa oh.
Me and my broken. 
Yeah, yeah.
Me and my broken.
Yeah, yeah yeah.
It's just me, it's just me, it's just me.
Me and my broken heart, yeah, yeah.
All I need's a little love in my life.
All I need's a little love in the dark.
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start.
Me and my broken heart.
I need a little loving tonight.
Hold me so I'm not falling apart.
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start.
Me and my broken heart.
