Lyrics
Namjaga da geureochi mwo narago dareugenni
Cheoeumen da akkyeojwodo naragabeorigo maneun
Namjaga da geureochi mwo narago teukbyeolhalkka
Ni mameul da gajyeodo naragabeorigo maneun
Namjaga da geureochi mwo

Jabeul su eobseul geot gatdeon ni mami
Jogeumssik nae sonane deureoodeoni
Ijen na eobsin sal su eopdan mari budamseureowo

Hoksina bamsae mami byeonhaesseul kkabwa
Nun tteumyeon moksoril hwaginhaebogo
Jigeumi yeongwonhagireul baraenneunde

Namjaga da geureochi mwo narago dareugenni
Cheoeumen da akkyeojwodo naragabeorigo maneun
Namjaga da geureochi mwo narago teukbyeolhalkka
Ni mameul da gajyeodo naragabeorigo maneun
Namjaga da geureochi mwo

Myeot bunigo geujeo baraman bogo
Son noheumyeon irheulkka himkkeot jwieotgo
Heeojime aswiwo myeot beonigo dorabwanneunde
Ijen neoboda apseoseo gireul geotgo
Malhal ttae deoneun ni nuneul bojil anko

Namjaga da geureochi mwo narago dareugenni
Cheoeumen da akkyeojwodo naragabeorigo maneun
Namjaga da geureochi mwo narago teukbyeolhalkka
Ni mameul da gajyeodo naragabeorigo maneun
Namjaga da geureochi mwo

Yeojaga da geureochi mwo neorago dareugenni
Nae mameul da algodo doraogireul baraneun
Yeojaga da geureochi mwo neorago teukbyeolhalkka
Anin jul almyeonseodo majimak igil baraneun
Yeojaga da geureochi mwo


English Translation
Men are all like that, I wouldn’t be any different
I valued you at first but then I flew away
Men are all like that, I wouldn’t be any special
I had all of your heart but then I flew away
Men are all like that

It seemed like I could never catch your heart
But little by little, your heart became to come into my hands
Now I feel burdened when you say you can’t live without me

I used to stay up all night, worried that your heart would change
When I opened my eyes, I called you to make sure of your voice
I used to hope that the moment would last forever

Men are all like that, I wouldn’t be any different
I valued you at first but then I flew away
Men are all like that, I wouldn’t be any special
I had all of your heart but then I flew away
Men are all like that

I used to just look at you for minutes
I held your hand tight, afraid that I might lose you if I let go
I used to be sad when we said goodbye so I turned back multiple times

Now I walk ahead of you
When we talk, I don’t look at your eyes
But it’s not because I don’t love you

Men are all like that, I wouldn’t be any different
I valued you at first but then I flew away
Men are all like that, I wouldn’t be any special
I had all of your heart but then I flew away
Men are all like that

Women are all like that, you wouldn’t be any different
You knew my heart but you hoped that I’d return
Women are all like that, you wouldn’t be any special
You knew it wasn’t but hoped that I would be your last
Women are all like that​
