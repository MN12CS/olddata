Hey Baby,
When things get crazy,
I just want to talk with you,
Don't keep me waiting,
You send me sailing,
C'mon, c'mon any day will do,

This could be my someday,
Love could be on the way,
Hello hello hello hello,
I just want to talk to you,
Hello hello hello hello,
Words of true devotion,

This city drives me crazy,
Say we'll make this life feel new,
Say you'll be mine some way,
I'll spend every day with you

This could be my someday,
Love could be on the way,
Hello hello hello hello,
I just want to talk to you,
Hello hello hello hello,
Words of true devotion,

Come into my world,
Live your life,
Spend all your days with me

Dial my number,

This could be my someday,
Love could be on the way,
Hello hello hello hello,
I just want to talk to you,
Hello hello hello hello,
Words of true devotion,

Dial my number,

Will my someday come here one day?
Will me someday come?
