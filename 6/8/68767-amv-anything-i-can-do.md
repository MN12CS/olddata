[Lyric]:
Day by day we have lost our edge
Don't you know, forgotten is the life we led
Now it seems you don't care what the risk is
The peaceful times are what made us blind
Can't look back, but we'll not come back
Can't be afraid, each time after time
So once again, I'm hiding in my room
The peaceful times are what made us blind
So you can't fly, and never try
You told me, oh long ago
But you left the wall
And tried again
So hold on our hopes with you
It was like a nightmare and it's painful for me
Cause' nobody wants to die too fast
Remember the day of grief
Now it's strange for me
I can see your face
I can hear your voice
Remember the day we met and it's painful for me
Cause' nobody wants to die too fast
Remember the day we dreamed
Now explain for me
I can see your face
I can hear your voice
Don't fall Reluctant Heroes
Oh give me your strength, our life is so short
Don't fall Reluctant Heroes
I wanna' be brave like you
From my heart
Don't fall Reluctant Heroes
Oh give me your strength, our life is so short
Don't fall Reluctant Heroes
I wanna' be brave like you
Can't look back, but we'll not come back
Can't be afraid, each time after time
So once again, I'm hiding in my room
The peaceful times are what made us blind.
So you can't fly, and never try
You told me, oh long ago
But you left the wall
And tried again
So hold on our hopes with you
It was like a nightmare and it's painful for me
Cause' nobody wants to die too fast
Remember the day of grief
And it's strange for me
I could see your face
I could hear your voice
Remember the day we met and it's painful for me
Cause' nobody wants to die too fast
Remember the day we dreamed
And it's painful for me
I could see your face
I could hear your voice
It was like a nightmare and it's painful for me
Cause' nobody wants to die too fast
Remember the day of grief
Now it strange for me
I can see your face
I can hear your voice
Remember day we met and it's painful for me
Cause' nobody wants to die too fast
Remember the day we dreamed
Now explain for me
I can see your face
I can hear your voice
