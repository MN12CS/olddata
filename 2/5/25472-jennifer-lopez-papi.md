## Jennifer Lopez - Papi

## Yuuki Nyoko

Let all the heat pour down
I'm good as long as he's around
He lets me wear the crown
I do my best to make him proud
 
Now I'm a superlady
I got my baby, if you got your baby, baby
 
Move your body, Move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, Rock your body,
Dance for your papi
 
Put your hands up in the air, dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air, ohohohohoh
 
Move your body, Move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, Rock your body,
Dance for your papi, ohohohohoh
 
My rock is shinning bright
Even if he ain't by my side
He make sure that I'm glow
I make sure everybody knows
 
Now I'm a superlady
I got my baby, if you got your baby, baby
 
Move your body, Move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, Rock your body,
Dance for your papi
 
Put your hands up in the air, dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air, ohohohohoh
 
Move your body, Move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, Rock your body,
Dance for your papi
 
Put your hands up in the air, dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air, ohohohohoh
 
Step up, step up
Let your head down
Pop drop and lock it all out
If tell up off the ground
Dance for your papi
 
Quiérelo, quiérelo
Suéltate el pelo
Levántate y calla seguramente
Ve con todas
Sí, eres lo máximo
Azota baldosa
Baila para tu Papi
 
Now I'm a superlady
I got my baby, if you got your baby, baby
 
Move your body, Move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, Rock your body,
Dance for your papi
 
Put your hands up in the air, dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air, ohohohohoh
 
Move your body, Move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, Rock your body,
Dance for your papi.
