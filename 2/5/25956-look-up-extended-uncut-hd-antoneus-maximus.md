## Look Up (EXTENDED UNCUT) HD - Antoneus Maximus

## Death Revived

"LOOK UP" LYRICS
(VERSE 1) 
Someday hopefully one day soon
I can fly pass the skies then I touch the moon
They say the sky's the limit
But I'm looking far beyond it
Aiming fora comet make a jump and grab on it
My heart beating the blood of the motherland
Running through my veins like the sand through an hour glass
Look to the stars and remember my name
"ANTONEUS" yeah I was born with game
So recognize it...I'm coming live and directly
Sonic Boom roll like thunder hit like lightning
Get consumed by nouns and verbs
I'm as real as it gets and that's the WORD
Yeah...I was raised in California
From San Jose to LA. and all over
Vietnam tatted on my heart
When you're thinking of me you're looking up the the stars
(VERSE2)
I'm early rising so I can catch the Sun
Live everyday like the last that's when you know you've won
Be proud of me mama yeah that's your son
I'm going galactic now...and second to none
To be the greatest...you have to BE the Greatest
Thinking outside the box draw better mazes
Play this 3 million years from now
And watch it still move a crowd
I got a signal I think I've made contact
The Mothership is on the way to take me back
Can't forget the Macbook and the weed sack
Play my new songs then I wait for the feedback
Yeah...I was raised in California
From San Jose to LA. and all over
Vietnam tatted on my heart
When you're thinking of me you're looking up the the stars
