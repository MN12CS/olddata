## [Tiểu thuyết] Me Talk Pretty One Day -  David Sedaris

## Deidara

​
Sedaris is Garrison Keillor’s evil twin: like the Minnesota humorist,  Sedaris (Naked) focuses on the icy patches that mar life’s sidewalk,  though the ice in his work is much more slippery and the falls much more  spectacularly funny than in Keillor’s. Many of the 27 short essays  collected here (which appeared originally in the New Yorker, Esquire and  elsewhere) deal with his father, Lou, to whom the book is dedicated.  Lou is a micromanager who tries to get his uninterested children to form  a jazz combo and, when that fails, insists on boosting David’s career  as a performance artist by heckling him from the audience. Sedaris  suggests that his father’s punishment for being overly involved in his  kids’ artistic lives is David’s brother Paul, otherwise known as “The  Rooster,” a half-literate miscreant whose language is outrageously  profane. Sedaris also writes here about the time he spent in France and  the difficulty of learning another language. After several extended  stays in a little Norman village and in Paris, Sedaris had progressed,  he observes, “from speaking like an evil baby to speaking like a  hillbilly. ‘Is thems the thoughts of cows?’ I’d ask the butcher,  pointing to the calves’ brains displayed in the front window.” But in  English, Sedaris is nothing if not nimble: in one essay he goes from his  cat’s cremation to his mother’s in a way that somehow manages to remain  reverent to both of the departed. “Reliable sources” have told Sedaris  that he has “tended to exhaust people,” and true to form, he will  exhaust readers of this new book, tooDwith helpless laughter. 16-city  author tour.
