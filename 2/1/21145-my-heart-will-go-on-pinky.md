## [My heart will go on] Pinky

Lâu lắm rồi mới xem lại Titanic, cảm giác vẫn như lần đầu mới xem! 

My heart will go on

Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you, go on
 
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you, go on
 
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
 
Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone
 
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold you
In my life we'll always go on
 
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
 
You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
