## Sweetbox - Read my mind

## teddyhangvu

Read my mind
Read my mind
In your eyes you look so weary
Fighting light with dark and dreary
And even though you can't hear me
I'll still sing
You go to church and pray on Sunday
You think your sins are cleaned up that way
Don't you know forgiveness just begins with you
 
If you could read my mind
Just read my mind
Then you could see
What's behind my eyes
If you could read my mind
Your hands untied
Cause the battlefield is tired
 
Get a little bit stupid sometimes
Get a little bit jealous sometimes
Sometiomes I'll be unfair but that's just me
I know that I'm not hiding
And I won't let your chains bind me
Because prefection is not the point of this
 
If you could read my mind
Just read my mind
Then you could see
What's behind my eyes
If you could read my mind
Your hands untied
Cause the battlefield is tired
 
If you could read my mind
Just read my mind
Then you could see
What's behind my eyes
If you could read my mind
Your hands untied
Cause the battlefield is tired
 
If love made sense
Then I think there would be a book
To tell us who is really right and wrong
But I don't want something simple
I don't want to sing a normal song
 
Let's just close our eyes and let it be
Cause the battlefield is tired
 
If you could read my mind
Just read my mind
Then you could see
What's behind my eyes
If you could read my mind
Your hands untied
Cause the battlefield is tired
 
Let's just close our eyes and let it be
Cause the battlefield is tired
