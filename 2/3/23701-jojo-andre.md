## JoJo - Andre

## teddyhangvu

He always fly as he wanna be
Cooler than a mother
And the girls always lookin’ but he’s just my lover
Andre (Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre)
Love How You Go Your Own Way (Andre)
Some people think he’s strange but he never try to hide it
Diamond in the rough and that’s just how I like it
That’s my Andre (Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre)
Love How You Go Your Own Way (A)
He wears a leather jacket in June
Got a convo straight to the moon
He’s the fire that you can’t contain
I get weak just sayin’ his name
So quiet raspberry beret
No friends but he came to me
He even got his own rules to the game
After him I’ll never be the same
When we get lifted as the night gets nearer
Vibe gets heavy and the clothes get wetter
I’m a sucker for a guy with a beautiful mind
And he’s all mine
He always fly as he wanna be
Cooler than a mother
The girls always lookin’ but he’s just my lover
Andre (Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre)
Love How You Go Your Own Way (Andre)
Some people think he’s strange but he never try to hide it
Diamond in the rough and that’s just how I like it
That’s my Andre (Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre)
Love How You Go Your Own Way (A)
See my man make you wanna invest
Got my heart beating out of my chest
And he sounds like Jazz to me
I can swear right out of my dreams
And I love how he go with the flow
Just chillin and not pressing the fish bowl
And I know it sounds kinda strange
It’s a love that you can’t explain
When we get lifted as the night gets nearer
Vibe gets heavy and the clothes get wetter
I’m a sucker for a guy with a beautiful mind
And he’s all mine
He always fly as he wanna be
Cooler than a mother
The girls always lookin’ but he’s just my lover
Andre (Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre)

Some people think he’s strange but he never try to hide it

That’s my Andre (Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Andre)
Love How You Go Your Own Way (A)
Probably knew you in some other life
Baby, I was your man and maybe you my wife
And I wouldn’t even question, wouldn’t think twice
It all makes perfect sense
And if ever you’re still not mine
I’ll can still love you from a distance til the end of time
And I hope we’ll be friends on down the line
It all makes perfect sense
He always fly as he wanna be
Cooler than a mother
The girls always lookin’ but he’s just my lover
