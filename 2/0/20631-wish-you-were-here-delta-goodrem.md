## Wish You Were Here - Delta Goodrem

## teddyhangvu

I've been knock, knock, knocking at the thought of your door 
But you're not, not, not here anymore 
I ring, ring, ring you’re every thought in my head 
But I can't get through, the connection is dead 
 
I want, want to tell you about the news today 
But you wouldn't believe me, you’d laugh it away 
There's a ghost standing at the foot of my bed 
And it's you, it's you, it's you, it was you 
 
They told me who was in trouble 
I couldn't breathe on the other side of the world 
And there was nothing I could do to help you 
And it's true today it'd be your birthday 
It would've been your 27th year 
And I miss you in the earth's atmosphere 
I wish you were here 
 
I go back, back, back at every memory you left 
But the clock ticks over every minute we shared 
On my knees begging for it not to be true 
But it was you, it was you, it was you, it was you 
 
They told me who was in trouble 
I couldn't breathe on the other side of the world 
And there was nothing I could do to help you 
And it's true today it'd be your birthday 
It would've been your 27th year 
And I miss you in the earth's atmosphere 
I wish you were here 
 
Instead of just in my dreams and in my imagination 
Confusing me completely from another dimension 
Can you see the beauty from a new beginning somewhere 
Because I feel like I won't repair with time 
 
They told me who was in trouble 
I couldn't breathe on the other side of the world 
And there was nothing I could do to help you 
And it's true today it'd be your birthday 
It would've been your 27th year 
And I miss you in the earth's atmosphere 
I wish you were here
