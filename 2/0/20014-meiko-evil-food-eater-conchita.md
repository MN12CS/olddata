Evil food eater ConchitaEnglish dubThe castle that smells of rotting, lying deep in it's hallways
The Last Supper that will soon begin again as always
Foods on the table that no soul should ever be dared to dine
And a woman smiling and eating them all up just fine.

This woman was referred to as Vanika Conchita
She was once the greatest Epicúreo Señorita
And then she decided to break the limits far beyond that
Now the worse food others wouldnt touch is where she's left off at.

Always respect and honor her, pay tribute to our great Conchita
Every food that exists today, they are all made only for her.

I'll eat up everything, everything that's in the world
Until I feel that the emptiness inside me is gone
The poison shining a sleek deadly blue
Is the very best spice for a main course dish.

Eating up all of every single thing to the bone
If it doesn't satisfy me, then I'll bite into plates
If it's a delicious meal, then my tongue is blissful
But wait until I decide at the end of the supper.

Once again, in fact 15th, her personal chef had appeared
He asked her the same question she always heard as he neared
"My Lady, would you please let me take some time off for a break ?"
Really, what was she doing, making the same useless mistake.

Always respect and honor her, pay tribute to our great Conchita
Anyone that dares betray her, they will end up paying the greatest price.

I'll eat up everything, everything that's in the world
Today, the menu is to be made especially special
The hair that's shining a sleek wonderful pale blue
Is the perfect topping for a salad hors d'oeuvres.

Eating up all of every single thing to the bone
If that's not satiating, then I'll eat "another"
Oh, my dearest young man, my butler standing there
Please let me no longer wonder what you can taste like.

After she ate all she did, her castle was then quite hollow
There was no one or anything left for her to swallow
Even then, she still wanted more, even if she ate so crude
The ultimate level of the horrible-both-ways type food.

I'll eat up everything, every bit that's in the world
When there was nothing left, I happened to look at my hand
Just in time to save me, I thought and gave a grin
"There's still something left that I haven't eaten yet".

The most horrible-both-ways food is Conchita
Eating it fresh, oh yes, I don't care that I'm eating me
Now I know the taste of everything that's in the world
But now nobody will ever know what I can taste like…
 
Enjoy…Liu…
