Hello everyone and thank you for visiting this topic!
As you can see, our forum has had an English version, which is called "Zorocode". I was really inspired by it, and the stories on our forum are too similar, so I decided to write a story in English, with the title "Zorocode Lifes". But this is the first time I try to write something so long in English, and my skill isn't really good. So if you're also interested in this idea, please join with me and together, we can get to know lots of people, help each others in English, create a mark for us, have a great time, but most of all, learn more about zodiac signs.
Here are my conditions:
 - Work as a team, be friendly with everyone
 - Inspired by this idea, have real passion
 - Like to study English and Literature
 - Have responsibility to your job (as an author)
* if you're signed in this idea but than you don't want to participate any more, PLEASE contact to me.
If you want to work with me and other people, please sign up through my Yahoo account: firefly_b0ttle, accord to this model:
Nickname on forum:
Date of birth (or DOB):
English level of skill (if you learn English at any center like Apollo, British Council,...):
Your sun sign, moon sign and ascendant:
After yourself, which zodiac do you understand the most:
*ATTENTION: This is a serious work, so make sure that you're ready for it!
Thank you!!
