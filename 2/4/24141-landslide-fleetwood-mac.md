## Landslide - Fleetwood Mac

## aquilliora

Live VideoGlee Cast versionLyricsI took my love and I took it down I climbed a mountain and I turned around And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills 'Till the landslide brought me down Oh, mirror in the sky What is love? Can the child within my heart rise above? Can I sail thru the changing ocean tides? Can I handle the seasons of my life? Mmm Mmm... [ Lyrics frWell, I've been afraid of changing 'Cause I've built my life around you But time makes you bolder Children get older I'm getting older too (Gutiar solo) Well, I've been afraid of changing 'Cause I, I built my life around you But time makes you bolder Children get older I'm getting older too I'm getting older too So, take my love, take it down Oh climb a mountain and turn around If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills Well the landslide will bring you down, down And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills Well maybe the landslide will bring it down Oh oh, the landslide will bring it down....Source: lyricsfreak
