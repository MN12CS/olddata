Music VideoLyricsHey! Hey! Hey!I don't like walking around this old and empty houseSo hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear[Video version:] The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake[Live version:] The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awakeIt's the house telling you to close your eyesSome days I can't even trust myselfIt's killing me to see you this way'Cause though the truth may varyThis ship will carryOur bodies safe to shoreHey! Hey! Hey!There's an old voice in my head that's holding me backWell tell her that I miss our little talksSoon it will be over and buried with our pastWe used to play outside when we were young,And full of life and full of love[Video version:] Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right[Live version:] Some days I feel like I'm wrong when I'm rightYour mind is playing tricks on you, my dear'Cause though the truth may varyThis ship will carryOur bodies safe to shoreHey!Don't listen to a word I sayHey!The screams all sound the sameHey!Though the truth may varyThis ship will carryOur bodies safe to shoreYou're gone gone gone awayI watched you disappearAll that's left is a ghost of youNow we're torn torn torn apart, there's nothing we can doJust let me go we'll meet again soonNow wait wait wait for mePlease hang aroundI'll see you when I fall asleepHey!Don't listen to a word I sayHey!The screams all sound the sameHey!Though the truth may varyThis ship will carryOur bodies safe to shoreDon't listen to a word I sayHey!The screams all sound the sameHey!Though the truth may varyThis ship will carryOur bodies safe to shoreThough the truth may varyThis ship will carryOur bodies safe to shoreThough the truth may varyThis ship will carryOur bodies safe to shoreSource: azlyrics
