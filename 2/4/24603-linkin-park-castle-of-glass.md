## aquilliora

LyricsTake me down to the river bend, Take me down to the fighting end, Wash the poison from off my skin Show me how to be whole again Fly me up on a silver wing Past the black where the sirens sing Warm me up in a nova's glow And drop me down to the dream below 'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass Hardly anything there for you to seeFor you to see Bring me home in blinding dream Through the secrets that I have seen Wash the sorrow from off my skin And show me how to be whole again 'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass Hardly anything there for you to seeFor you to seeFor you to see'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass Hardly anything else I need to be 'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass Hardly anything there for you to seeFor you to see For you to seeFor you to seeSource: songmeanings.net
