## [ Made by Tanpopo ] [ English lyrics ] The lost memory

## Liu Anney

[ Made by Tanpopo ]
 The lost memory
Setting of soggy sepia
Begin to show up in my mind
Look up into the boring sky
Evening full of sad and deep sigh.
 
Lonelyness keep rising
Estimate over the limit
Memories have been stolen, lie and truth
Apprehensive
Why time is keep passing in cruel
Why is here, I really don’t know.
 
Only
Coolly is left in here
Makes the heart keep meltdown after the break-up
I can’t remember that really important message to me.
 
Remember
Just look at me and tell me ! 
This love of dirty and sin
If time could circulate turn around
I want just one more time to know
The change of shiny season with you.
 
Remember
Please look at me and tell me
Always is just nullity
Why is my tears keep roll on my cheeks ?
To the place that time could circulate turn around
In where this pain keep abiding and doesn’t stop ?
 
Disengage every hair of soft and wet
Cover the mystery wrinkle behind
Very deep into your eyes
There is a silence sorrow, deep, deep, deep inside.
 
Say a enteral promise
That will rescue you out of this place
Swallow this poison like a cruel nightmare
Blazing lights make me can’t see
The face of your
Lights of blazing, light up the darkness
It is just illusion.
 
Remember
Just look at me and tell me ! 
This love of dirty and sin
If time could circulate turn around
I want just one more time to know
The change of shiny season with you.
 
Remember
Please look at me and tell me
Always is just nullity
Why is my tears keep roll on my cheeks ?
To the place that time could circulate turn around
In where this pain keep abiding and doesn’t stop ?
 
How many time did I call out loud your name in sadness ?
I want you to remember this voice even you’re cursed.
 
Remember
Memories is now return a gain
Turn into broken pieces and stab into my chest
You have gone out of this place
When known the answer
Although know that is naiv is being killed.
 
String of destiny is now tight back together
If I keep tight and tight and tight back
It will just keep break up again and again
In spite of the fact I know this is a really mistake.
 
Remember
Please, keep sink in darkness.
Remember.
 
Enjoy....Liu......Tanpopo...
