## Dancing With A Broken Heart - Delta Goodrem

## Yuuki Nyoko

Held my breath as the last wave pulls me under, under
What doesn't kill you makes you so much stronger, stronger
Can you feel this pain
Rushing through these veins
Driving me insane,
But I won't break,
 
I won't look back tonight,
This is the time of my life,
Underneath these stars,
I'm dancing with a broken heart,
Fight fire with fire,
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher,
Dancing with a broken heart,
 
I'm gonna bury all the past just six feet under under,
I'm gonna make you stumble like lightning and thunder, thunder
I won't let dogs lie
In the peace and quiet,
Moving on to another time
 
I won't look back tonight,
This is the time of my life,
Underneath these stars,
Dancing with a broken heart,
Fight fire with fire,
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher,
Dancing with a broken heart,
 
Can you feel this pain
Rushing through these veins
Driving me insane,
But I won't break,
 
I won't look back tonight,
This is the time of my life,
Underneath these stars,
Dancing with a broken heart,
Fight fire with fire,
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher,
Dancing with a broken heart.
 Have fun~~
