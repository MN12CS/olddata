## Sunday Morning - Maroon 5

## BeginAgain

Sunday morning, praise the dawning 
 It's just a restless feeling by my side 
 Early dawning, sunday morning 
 It's just the wasted years so close behind 

 Watch out, the world's behind you 
 There's always someone around you who will call 
 It's nothing at all 

Sunday morning and I'm falling 
I've got a feeling I don't want to know 
Early dawning, sunday morning 
It's all the streets you crossed, not so long ago 

Watch out, the world's behind you 
There's always someone around you who will call 
It's nothing at all 

Watch out, the world's behind you 
There's always someone around you who will call 
It's nothing at all 

Sunday morning
