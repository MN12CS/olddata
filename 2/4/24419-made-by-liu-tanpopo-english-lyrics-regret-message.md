## [ Made by Liu & Tanpopo ] [ English lyrics ] Regret message

## Liu Anney

[ Made by Liu & Tanpopo ]
 Regret message 
On a deck, by ocean, not far away from the town
The girl’s still standing in quiet sadness
It is just a legent, long ago, once upon ‘time
Ocean’s carrying a secret.
 
‘Just write your wish on a piece of paper…’ 
Then put it in a glass bottle
Ocean will take it, let it go deep into sea
You wish will be soon come true.
 
The bottle softly floating away
Carry the paper and a wish inside
Drift to the ocean of extensive
And slowly disappear.
 
You have always been there, and then made my wishes come true
Even it’s opposite to your wish, brother
I didn’t attent that I was too selfish
And bother you with those wishes.
 
Brother, you’re the one always gave me everything
Now, where are you then, tell me ?
So I will send to the ocean my wish
It’ll help me bring my message.
 
The waves continue to bring my wish go far
Regret’s tears dropping into blue water
Tell me why, when I relize all of my sins
Destiny give a dot for everything.
 
Softly flow away, a small bottle
Carry the paper and a wish inside 
Drift to the ocean of extensive 
And slowly disappear.
 
The waves brings the small wish go far away
And left the tears dropping with regret
If I could somehow be reborn to live again…
 
Enjoy....Liu......Tanpopo...
