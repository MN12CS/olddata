## [ Made by Liu & Tanpopo ] [ English lyrics ] Kokoro

## Liu Anney

[ Made by Liu & Tanpopo ]
With John helps ( Thanks a lot~ ).Kokoro
Do you know that I’m a robot was made by a lonesome creator ?
When I was invent, they called ‘magical’.
But there’s still one thing I need, the thing that he doesn’t have
It is just ‘kokoro’, you know, a special progam.
 
Few hundred years later time has gone
Now, the robot, just a lonesome kid
The robotto of magical, have a wish.
 
I wanna know ‘bout creator
How did he do to his last breath 
He made this, just for me.
 
Magic heart.
 
Now, you know, when the magic, starting to appear in my soul
Why ? Tell me, why do my tears keep roll on my cheek ?
Why am I shaking like this ? What are the beating in my chest ?
Isn’t that the magic heart I used to wish ?
 
Mystery magic heart, magic heart of mystery
All of the moment of fun that I used to have
Mystery magic heart, with a mystery feeling
All the sad that I used to know
Mystery magic heart, with a mystery feeling
All of them make me feel hurt.
 
Now, I surely know why I was born
Being alone surely is sad
Yes, right there, right on the day
My feelings suddenly keep rising.
 
Now, I can tell all of the words that belong to my soul
All for you, the one that have bring me to life.
 
Thank you so much
Thanks very much
Cause you have let me born into this world
Thank you so much
Thanks very much
For all the days you’ve here with me
Thank you so much
Thanks very much
For the things that you’ve bring to me
Thank you so much
Thanks very much
I’ll sing this endless song.
 
Enjoy....Liu......Tanpopo...
