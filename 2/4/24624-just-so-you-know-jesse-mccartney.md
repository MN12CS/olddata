## Just So You Know - Jesse Mccartney

## BeginAgain

I shouldn't love you but i want to
I just can't turn away
I shouldn't see you but i can't move
I can't look away

And i dont know how to be fine when i'm not
Cause i don't know how to make the feelings stop

Just so you know
This feelings takin control
Of me and i can't help it
I wont sit around
I can't let him win now
Though you should know
I've tryed my best to let go of you
But i don't want to
I just gutta say it all before you go
Just so you know

It's gettin hard to
Be around you
Theres so much i can't say
And do you want me to hide the feelings
And look away

And i dont know how to be fine when i'm not
Cause i don't know how to make the feelings stop

Just so you know
This feelings takin control
Of me and i can't help it
I wont sit around
I can't let him win now
Though you should know
I've tryed my best to let go of you
But i don't want to
I just gutta say it all before you go
Just so you know

This emptyness is killin me
I'm wonderin why i've waited so long
Lookin back i realize it was always there to be spoken
Now i'm waitin here
Been waitin here

Just so you know
This feelings takin control
Of me and i can't help it
I wont sit around
I can't let him win now
Though you should know
I've tryed my best to let go of you
But i don't want to
I just gutta say it all before you go
Just so you know
