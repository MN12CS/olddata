Everywhere I go
Everything I do
Reminds me of you
 
Just a picture on the wall
I'm surrounded by it all
Gotta walk before I fall, yeah
 
Fall out, out on the street                                                  
Streetlight, light up for me
So far from where I used to be
 
When she was mine
Everything was easy
Everything was simple
Never felt so good
When she was mine
I wanted to remember
Never missed a second
Now I wish I could forget
 
Forget when she was mine, mine, yeah
When she was mine, mine, yeah
 
What I miss the most
Is talking up all night
We laughed until we cried
 
Now I'm breaking at the seams
Dropping to my knees
Nothing left of me, no
 
Like stone turned into dust
My heart wasn't enough
So far from where I used to be
 
When she was mine
Everything was easy
Everything was simple
Never felt so good
When she was mine
I wanted to remember
Never missed a second
Now I wish I could forget
 
Forget when she was mine, mine, yeah
When she was mine, mine, yeah
When she was mine
 
Wonder if she's out there
Wonder where she goes, she goes
Wonder what she's doing
Will I ever know, yeah
 
Everything was easy
Everything was simple
Never felt so good
When she was mine
I wanted to remember
Never missed a second
Now I wish I could forget
 
Forget when she was mine, mine, yeah
When she was mine, mine, yeah
 
I'm down on my knees
Gotta see her, gotta see her, gotta see her, yeah
I tried to forget
But I need her, but I need her, but I need her
 
I'm down on my knees
Gotta see her, gotta see her, gotta see her
I tried to forget
But I need her, but I need her, but I need her.
 
When she was mine.
