## Back to December - Taylor Swift

## pinpuru

**Back to December**​                                                        -- by Taylor Swift --​ ​ ​ 
“Đã lâu rồi chúng ta có thể gặp nhau, hãy kể cho em nghe đi. Nhưng dường như thời gian đã tạo nên khoảng cách quá lớn giữa hai chúng ta.
 
Giờ đây, em đứng trước anh và nói câu xin lỗi. Có thể em tự do nhưng những gì em còn lại là nỗi nhớ anh. Em ước gì mình có thể quay lại tháng mười hai ấy để sửa lại những gì đã vỡ, để níu kéo cái tình yêu chớm nở trong tiết trời thu nay đã héo úa. Em ước mình có thể quay lại nhưng thời gian đã không ưu ái cho em...
 
Đã quá muộn để hối hận...
 
Đã quá muộn để quay lại, phải không anh?”
 

 

 

 

 

 
-----<Lyrics>-----​ ​I’m so glad you made time to see me
 How’s life, tell me how’s your family
 I haven’t seen them in awhile
 You’ve been good, busier than ever
 Small talk, work and the weather
 Your guard is up and I know why
 Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
 You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
 Standing in front of you saying I’m sorry for that night
 And I go back to December all the time
 It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
 Wishing I’d realized what I had when you were mine
 I’d go back to December turn around and make it all right.
 I’d go back to December all the time.

 These days, I haven’t been sleeping
 Staying up late playing back myself leaving
 When you’re birthday passed, and I didn’t call
 And I think about summer all the beautiful times
 I watched you laughing from the passenger side, and
 I realized I loved you in the fall
 And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
 You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
 Standing in front of you saying I’m sorry for that night
 And I go back to December all the time
 It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
 Wishing I’d realized what I had when you were mine
 I’d go back to December turn around and change my own mind
 I’d go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin,
 Your sweet smile,
 So good to me, so right
 And how you held me in your arms that September night
 The first time you ever saw me cry
 Maybe this is wishful thinking,
 Probably myself dreaming,
 But if you loved again, I swear I’d love you right
 I’d go back in time and change it, but I can’t
 So if the chain is on your door, I understand

 But this is me swallowing my pride
 Standing in front of you saying I’m sorry for that night
 And I go back to December all the time
 It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
 Wishing I’d realized what I had when you were mine
 I’d go back to December turn around and make it all right
 I’d go back to December turn around and change my own mind
 I’d go back to December all the time.
 All the time....​-----<<0o0>>-----​
