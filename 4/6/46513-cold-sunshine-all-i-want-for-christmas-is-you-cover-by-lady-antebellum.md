Giai điệu nhẹ nhàng, lời ca ấm áp, một bài hát rất tuyệt để nghe trong dịp Giáng sinh. 

Lời bài hát:I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need I don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you,baby You, baby I don't need to hang my stocking There upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on Christmas dayI just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you, babyAll the lights are shining So brightly everywhere  And the sound of childrens' Laughter fills the airAnd everyone is singin' I hear those sleigh bells ringin' Santa won't you bring me The one I really need?Oh, bring my baby to meI don't want a lot for Christmas This is all I'm askin' for I just wanna see my baby Standing right outside my doorI just want him for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you, baby You, baby You, baby You...
