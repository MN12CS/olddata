Lyrics
What Makes You Beautiful

You're insecure
 Don't know what for
 You're turning heads when you walk through the door
 Don't need make up
 To cover up
 Being the way that you are is enough


 Everyone else in the room can see it
 Everyone else but you


 Baby you light up my world like nobody else
 The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
 But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
 You don't know
 You don't know you're beautiful
 If only you saw what I can see
 You'll understand why I want you so desperately
 Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
 You don't know
 You don't know you're beautiful
 Oh oh
 But that's what makes you beautiful


 So c-come on
 You got it wrong
 To prove I'm right I put it in a song
 I don't why
 You're being shy
 And turn away when I look into your eyes


 Everyone else in the room can see it
 Everyone else but you
 
 
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
 The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
 But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
 You don't know
 You don't know you're beautiful
 If only you saw what I can see
 You'll understand why I want you so desperately
 Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
 You don't know
 You don't know you're beautiful
 Oh oh
 But that's what makes you beautiful


 Nana Nana Nana Nana
 Nana Nana Nana Nana
 Nana Nana Nana Nana


 Baby you light up my world like nobody else
 The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
 But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
 You don't know
 You don't know you're beautiful


 Baby you light up my world like nobody else
 The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
 But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
 You don't know
 You don't know you're beautiful
 If only you saw what I can see
 You'll understand why I want you so desperately
 Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
 You don't know
 You don't know you're beautiful
 Oh oh
 But that's what makes you beautiful
