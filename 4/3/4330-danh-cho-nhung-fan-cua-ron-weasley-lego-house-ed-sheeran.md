 I'm gonna pick up the pieces,
 and build a lego house
if things go wrong we can knock it down

My three words have two meanings,
there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December, 
but I've got ya to keep me warm
and if you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things I've done 
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done 
I think I love you better now, now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
and colour you in
if things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall

And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
and I will surrender up my heart
and swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things I've done 
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done 
I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking 
and it's more than I can take

And if it's dark in a cold December, 
I've got ya to keep me warm
and if you're broken then I will mend ya 
and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things I've done 
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done 
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things I've done 
I will love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done 
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
