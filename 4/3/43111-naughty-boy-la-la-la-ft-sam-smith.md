La La,la la la ........ Hush, don't speak 
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it 
When you hiss and preach 
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire 

I can't find your silver lining 
I don't mean to judge 
But when you read your speech, it's tiring 
Enough is enough 

I'm covering my ears like a kid 
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la 
I'm turning off the volume when you speak 
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it I go 
La la, la la la... 
La la, la la la... 
I find a way to block it I go 
La la, la la la... 
La la, la la la... 

Yes our love is running out of time 
I won't count the hours, rather be a coward 
When our words collide 
I'm gonna drown you out before I lose my mind 

I can't find your silver lining 
I don't mean to judge 
But when you read your speech, it's tiring 
Enough is enough 

I'm covering my ears like a kid 
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la 
I'm turning off the volume when you speak 
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it I go 
La la la la la... 
La la la la la... 
I find a way to block it I go 
La la la la la... 
La la la la la... 
I find a way to block it, oh 
La la la la la... 
La la la la la... 
I've found a way to block it I go 
La la la la la... 
La la la la la... 

I'm covering my ears like a kid 
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la 
I'm turning off the volume when you speak 
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it I go 

I'm covering my ears like a kid 
when your words mean nothing, I go la la la 
I'm turning off the volume when you speak 
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it I go 
La la la la la... 
La la la la la... 
La la la la la... 
La la la la la...
