Author's note:
 
Hello everyone, my name is Anna, as you can see in the author. So, I khow I am a little bit greedy because I still have one more fic to go, but... these words keep running in my brain. I have to let it out by writing a new one. Seem to be a lie to me. Anyway, this is not about the twelve stars and it will have ten chapters, I hope. I just deleted the fiction Tình yêu không dựa vào số đo because it was so... you know, empty. Nobody can give me more passion to continue.
 
This one will be a little bit similar to my style. It will be about blood, murderer and hide from the law. I hope I can get your attention to this fic and I can get some comments, a real one from you guys. 
 
Have a nice day!
 
P/S. I will post three to four chapters a week! 
 ~ Anna Cao ~SumaryIt's cold. Very cold. I don't know what I am doing here. I am standing outside my garden. In my hand, there is a scissors and... it has blood in it. A female body is in front of me. She's death, real death. Her blood covers my hands. I still can feel the warmth of the blood. The snow is red. Because blood is red. Did I just kill a person? I have no idea. What am I gonna do with that body? I don't know.What I can remember is I saw her standing there, she turned her back on me. I grabbed a scissor and... stabbed her. A lot. Until she fell down. And died.Now, everything's perfect.  ~ Anna Cao ~
