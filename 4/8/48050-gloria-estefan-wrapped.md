​ ​Keep every tear like an ocean​For everyday that my ​me from being with you​I cradle your faith that reveals me,​Grows like a flower, then heals me​Fills me with promise anew​I carry you on disillusion​When my pathetic confusion​Kept me from speaking the truth​Simply a coin in your fountain​Lost like the seconds I'm counting'Til I am closer to you​I cherish every morning that found us​With the night scattered around us​Faded and painting me blue​I carry your joy in my footsteps​Making my way to your harborI don't need to go any further​You are my sun and my moon​Wrapped in your arms where it's peaceful​Back in your arms where I'm happy​I would do anything gladly​Only to see you again​Wrapped in your arms I can wander​Up to the heaven's above me​Hearing you say that you love me​Back in your arms where I'm free​Keep every phrase barely spoken​Left from your lipsThey have broken​Free as you give me your love​The yearning is constant and steady​When I'm with youI'm already​Everything I can become​I cherish every morning that found us​With the night scattered around us​Faded and painting me blue​I carry your joy in my footsteps​Making my way to your harbor​I don't need to go any further​You are my sun and my moon​Wrapped in your arms I can wander​Up to the heaven's above me​Hearing you say that you love me​Back in your arms where I'm free​Wrapped in your arms I can wander​Up to the heaven's above me​Hearing you say that you love me​Back in your arms where I'm free​
