## [Event 1/2] Bottom Of The Ocean

## DarkSecrets

​ ​"It's been in the past for a while​I get a flash and I smile​Am I crazy?​Still miss you baby . . ."​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​"It was real, it was right . . .​But it burned too hot to survive.​All that's left is,​All these ashes."​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​"Where does the love go?​I don't know​When it's all said and done​How could I be losing you forever?​After all the time we spent together."​ ​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​"In a dream you appeared,​For a while you were here . . .​So I keep sleeping,​Just to keep you with me."​ ​

 
 ​​ ​"I'll draw a map,​Connect the dots,​With all the memories that I've got.​What I'm missing,​I'll keep re-living."​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​"I have to know why,​I had to lose you.​Now you've just become . . . ​Like everything I'll never find again,​At the bottom of the ocean."​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​"This is it​Let go​Breathe . . ."​ ​​ ​"You don't have to love me​For me to, baby, ever understand​Just know I love the time that we both had​And I don't ever want to see you sad, be happy​Cause I don't want to hold you​If you don't want to tell me you love me babe​Just know I'm gonna have to walk away​I'll be big enough for both of us to say, be happy." ​ ​
 
 
 

 

 

 

 
Sometimes, I find myself back when I see the ocean. ​I do believe that we have our own ocean inside each of us, maybe in our soul.​Some how, I'm in love with you. ​But then, you're just like those waves . . . Come, and pass away . . . ​When I realised that I had lost you, I kept looking for something I didn't even know.​No matter how far you've been. I will be like the ocean. ​I will stay . . . and wait for something that I don't know.​ ​"What are you looking for ?"​"I don't know."​"Why are you keep looking when you don't even know what it is ?"​"Maybe because It was left at the bottom of the ocean."​ ​
