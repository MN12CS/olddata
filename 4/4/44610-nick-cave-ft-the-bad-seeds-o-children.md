## Nick Cave ft The Bad Seeds - O Children

## DarkSecrets

Bài hát "Muggle" khi Harry và Hermione khiêu vũ.
Cảnh phim này vốn không có trong nguyên tác của J.K.Rowling. Nhưng chính cảnh phim này đã gợi cho chúng tôi - những Potterheads, một cảm xúc khó tả.
Âm nhạc nhẹ nhàng, chậm rãi, khiến chúng tôi như trở về với ngày đầu tiên trên xe lửa. 
Đã mười năm, tình bạn vẫn luôn còn đó. 
Dường như không có gì thay đổi. Dường như hình ảnh năm nào vẫn đang hiện ra trước mắt.
Thực ra, chúng tôi cũng đã là những đứa trẻ. Chỉ là những đứa trẻ mà thôi . . .
 

 
O Children​ 
Pass me that lovely little gun
My dear, my darling one
The cleaners are coming, one by one
You don't even want to let them start

They are knocking now upon your door
They measure the room, they know the score
They're mopping up the butcher's floor
Of your broken little hearts

O children

Forgive us now for what we've done
It started out as a bit of fun
Here, take these before we run away
The keys to the gulag

O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice

Here comes Frank and poor old Jim
They're gathering round with all my friends
We're older now, the light is dim
And you are only just beginning

O children

We have the answer to all your fears
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal clear
It's round about and it's somewhere here
Lost amongst our winnings

O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice

The cleaners have done their job on you
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
They're lining up to inspect you

O children

Poor old Jim's white as a ghost
He's found the answer that we lost
We're all weeping now, weeping because
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you

O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice

Hey little train! We are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station

Hey, little train! Wait for me!
I once was blind but now I see
Have you left a seat for me?
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?

Hey little train! Wait for me!
I was held in chains but now I'm free
I'm hanging in there, don't you see
In this process of elimination

Hey little train! We are all jumping on 
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
It's beyond my wildest expectation

Hey little train! We are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station.​
