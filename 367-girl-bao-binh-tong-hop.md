		Inconsistency and confusion describe the         characteristics profile of an Aquarius female. The same goes for her         love life too. She is very loyal, but at the same time, she is also a         little detached and not extremely emotional. She will be committed and         remain faithful too, but do not try to bind her. Let her enjoy her         freedom and in return, she will come back to you when she gets tired of         her expeditions. Her dreams are very different from that of a normal          female and she hums a different tune, which most of us have not even         heard of. 
         
         An Aquarian female is like a butterfly, which sits on every flower, but         belongs to none. She loves her freedom and if you can accept this, she         will love you even more. Within her boundless limits, her love will also         be limitless. Position and power matter to her more than money and bank         balance. If you want her to fall in love with you, be true and honest,         not only to others, but also to yourself. You don't need to follow her         rules. You can form your own code of ethics, but be sure to live by         them. 
         
         Passion is not one of the personality traits of Aquarian girl. Rather,         her love will be subtle and unassuming. She is intense, but may prefer         to be platonic most of the time. Hosting as well as attending parties         comes naturally to her and she will always be a social delight. She will         trust you completely and will not be unduly suspicious of your         activities. You will also not be bothered by too much jealousy or         possessiveness on her part. Her trust arises from the fact that before         committing, she had dissected your behavior under a microscope. 
         
         Only after being convinced of your integrity did she take the next         step. Still, if you become unfaithful to her, she will be extremely hurt         and is likely to remember the wound for a long time. With an Aquarian         female, out of sight means out of mind too. So, make sure to be around         here always. She has a very strong will power. If she thinks the         relationship is not working and has no chances of improving also, she         will break it right away; though doing so may tear her heart into two         pieces. Like every Aquarian, she will remember her first love throughout         her life. 
         
         It's no use getting upset, better be the first love in her life. She         will never ever be dishonest in a relationship and even if she indulges         in an extra-marital affair, it will end before it even started. She will         always try to know your deepest thoughts and secrets, but her own dreams         will be beyond your reach. Conversing with an Aquarian female is usually         a delight because of her charming manners. Her mind is quite         unpredictable and you will find it hard keeping track. She will live in         the present, then suddenly be wistful about yesterday and then, become         enthusiastic about tomorrow. 
         
         She may talk about fairies one day and discard elves as humbug, the         other. Never look down on her or she might never look upto you. She         respects you and will expect the same in return. As mothers, Aquarian         women tend to be very loving and caring. Though in the beginning, they         may be a little nervous about the whole idea of motherhood. But once         they become comfortable with it, it will come to them naturally. An         Aquarius female may find it difficult to express her love in the form of         hugs and kisses and you will have to teach her that. She will never         overburden the kids with protection.
         
         At the same time, she will always be a patient listener to their         childhood and adolescent problems. Teaching them discipline will also be         your responsibility. However, for all this to happen you will have to         convince her to get married and this certainly isn't an easy job. You         will also have to teach her romance, since expressing emotions does not         come too easily to her. She will happily hold your hand and walk besides         you, but don't expect her to gaze into your eyes for hours at a stretch. 
         
         Don't smother your Aquarian girl with too much closeness, she needs her         space and will give you, yours too. Things like suspicion,         possessiveness, chauvinism and criticism turn her off. Just be nice to         her odd bunch of friends and she will warmly welcome yours into the         house. Make use of her intuition and insight, it may help you in solving         a problem or two. It may seem like wishful thinking now, but then,         remember she looks in the future. Hold her hand and she will let you see         the future too, where both of you are cozily living together!Click to expand...
