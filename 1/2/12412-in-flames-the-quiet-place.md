## In Flames - The Quiet Place

## cá ươn

Spinning further, deeperI know you're out to try meI'm not in this to be a slavePush the dirt, make me feelLocate what swallows lifeNight bird you build my world..and then I close my eyes..and then I close my eyesJudge me nowUsed to be afraid to let it show, bow downA king in my own mindEverything's in place so much brighter from todayDrown the monsterMake all bad dreams go awayWhatever it takes to keep your hands freeOpen scars, the quiet placeAll the bridges fall to the ground and you say you sacrificed..and then I close my eyes..and then I close my eyesJudge me nowUsed to be afraid to let it show, bow down, bow down!A king in my own mindEverything's in place so much brighter from todayA king in my own mindJudge me nowA king in my own mindJudge me nowA king in my own mindJudge me nowUsed to be afraid to let it show, Bow down, bow down!A king in my own mindEverything's in place so much brighter from todayA king in my own mind
