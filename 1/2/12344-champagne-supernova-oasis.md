Oasis - Champagne Supernova

In a 2009 interview, Noel told the following anecdote:
 This writer, he was going on about the lyrics to "Champagne Supernova", and he actually said to me: ‘You know, the one thing that’s stopping it being a classic is the ridiculous lyrics.’ And I went: ‘What do you mean by that?’ And he said: ‘Well, Slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannonball — what’s that mean?’ And I went: ‘I don’t fucking know. But are you telling me, when you’ve got 60,000 people singing it, they don’t know what it means? It means something different to every one of them.
According to Wikipedia​ 
 


 
How many special people change? 
 How many lives are living strange? 
 Where were you while we were getting high? 
 Slowly walking down the hall 

 Faster than a cannonball 
 Where were you while we were getting high? 
 Someday you will find me 
 Caught beneath the landslide 

 In a champagne supernova in the sky 
 Someday you will find me 
 Caught beneath the landslide 
 In a champagne supernova 

 A champagne supernova in the sky 
 Wake up the dawn and ask her why 
 A dreamer dreams, she never dies 
 Wipe that tear away now from your eye 

 Slowly walking down the hall 
 Faster than a cannonball 
 Where were you while we were getting high? 
 Someday you will find me 

 Caught beneath the landslide 
 In a champagne supernova in the sky 
 Someday you will find me 
 Caught beneath the landslide 

 In a champagne supernova 
 A champagne supernova 
 'Cause we don't believe 
 That they're gonna get away from the summer 

 But you and I will never die 
 The world's still spinning around we don't know why 
 Why-why-why-why-i-i 

 How many special people change? 
 How many lives are living strange? 
 Where were you while we were getting high? 
 Slowly walking down the hall 

 Faster than a cannonball 
 Where were you while we were getting high? 
 Someday you will find me 
 Caught beneath the landslide 

 In a champagne supernova in the sky 
 Someday you will find me 
 Caught beneath the landslide 
 In a champagne supernova 

 A champagne supernova 
 'Cause we don't believe 
 That they're gonna get away from the summer 
 But you and I will never die 

 The world's still spinning around we don't know why 
 Why-why-why-why-i-i 

 How many special people change? 
 How many lives are living strange? 
 Where were you while we were getting high? 
 We were getting high
