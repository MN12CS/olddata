## teddyhangvu

Underneath the moonUnderneath the starsHere's a little heartFor youUp above the worldUp above it allHere's a hand to hold on toBut if i should breakIf i should fall awayWhat am i to doI need someone to takeA little of the weightOr I'll fall throughYou're just the one that I've been waiting forI'll give you all that I have to give and moreBut don't let me fallTake a little timeWalk a little lineGot the balance right ahaGive a little loveGimme just enoughSo that i can hang on tightWe will be alrightI'll be by your sideI won't let you downBut i gotta knowNo matter how things goThat you will be aroundYou're just the one that i've been waiting forI'll give you all that i have to give and moreBut don't let me fallDon't let me fallUnderneath the moonUnderneath the starsHere's a little heart For youUp above the worldUp above it allHere's a hand to hold on toYou're just the one that I've been waiting forI'll give you all that I have to give and moreBut don't let me fallYou'll be the one that I'll love forever moreI'll be here holding you high above it allBut don't let me fall
