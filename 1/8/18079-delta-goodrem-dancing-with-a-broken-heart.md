## Delta Goodrem - Dancing With A Broken Heart

## teddyhangvu

"Dancing With A Broken Heart"Held my breath as the last wave pulled me under, under.What doesn’t kill you makes you so much stronger, stronger.Can you feel this pain,Rushing through these veins,Driving me insane,But I won’t break.I won’t look back tonight,This is the time of my life,Underneath these stars,I’m dancing with a broken heart.Fight fire with fire,The truth to a liar,I’m going higher,I'm Dancing with a broken heart.I’m gonna bury all the past that sinks me under, under.I’m gonna make a storm from lightning and thunder, thunder.I won’t let dogs lie,In the peace and quiet,Moving on to another time.I won’t look back tonight,This is the time of my life,Underneath these stars,I’m dancing with a broken heart.Fight fire with fire,The truth to a liar,I’m going higher,I'm Dancing with a broken heart.Can you feel this pain,Rushing through these veins,Driving me insane,But I won’t break.I won’t look back tonight,This is the time of my life,Underneath these stars,I’m dancing with a broken heart.Fight fire with fire,The truth to a liar,I’m going higher,I'm Dancing with a broken heart.
