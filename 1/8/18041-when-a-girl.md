## When a girl....

## teddyhangvu

When a GIRL is quiet,​Millions of things are running in her mind​ ​When a GIRL is not arguing,​She is thinking deeply​ ​When a GIRL looks at u with eyes full of questions,​She is wondering how long you will be around​ ​When a GIRL answers "i'm fine" after a few seconds,​She is not at all fine​ ​When a GIRL stares at you,​She is wondering why you are lying​ ​When a GIRL lays on your chest,​She is wishing for you to be hers forever​ ​When a GIRL calls you everyday,​She is seeking for your attention​ ​When a GIRL sms's u everyday,​She wants you to reply at least once​ ​When a GIRL says I love you,​She means it​ ​When a GIRL says that she can't live without you,​She has made up her mind that you are her future​ ​When a GIRL says "i miss you",​No one in this world can miss you more​than that.​ ​by Rian​​
