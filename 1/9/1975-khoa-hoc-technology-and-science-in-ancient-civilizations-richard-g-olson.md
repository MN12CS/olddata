 [TD="class: alt2"] Why did the Greeks excel in geometry, but lag begin the Mesopotamians in  arithmetic? How were the great pyramids of Egypt and the Han tombs in  China constructed? What did the complex system of canals and dykes in  the Tigris and Euphrates river valley have to do with the deforestation  of Lebanon's famed cedar forests? This work presents a cross-cultural  comparison of the ways in which the ancients learned about and preserved  their knowledge of the natural world, and the ways in which they  developed technologies that enabled them to adapt to and shape their  surroundings. Covering the major ancient civilizations - those of  Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, Greece, the Indus Valley, and Meso-America -  Olson explores how language and numbering systems influenced the social  structure, how seemingly beneficial construction projects affected a  civilization's rise or decline, how religion and magic shaped both  medicine and agriculture, and how trade and the resulting cultural  interactions transformed the making of both everyday household items and  items intended as art. Along the way, Olson delves into how scientific  knowledge and its technological applications changed the daily lives of  the ancients.
