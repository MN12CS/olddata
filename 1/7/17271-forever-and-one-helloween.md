## Goblin Ed

What can I do?Will I be getting through?Now that I must try to leave it all behindDid you see what you have done to me?So hard to justifySlowly it's passing byForever and one I will miss youHowever, I kiss you yet againWay down in NeverlandSo hard I was tryingTomorrow I'll still be cryingHow could you hide your liesYour liesHere I amSeeing you once againMy mind's so far awayMy heart's so close to stayToo proud to fightI'm walking back into nightWill I ever find someone to believe?Forever and one I will miss youHowever, I kiss you yet againWay down in NeverlandSo hard I was tryingTomorrow I'll still be cryingHow could you hide your liesYour lies
