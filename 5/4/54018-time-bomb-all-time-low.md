From the get-go, I knew this was hard to hold 
Like a crash, the whole thing spun out of control 
Oh, on a wire, we were dancing 
Two kids, no consequences 
Pull the trigger without thinking 
There's only one way down this road 

It was like a time bomb set into motion 
We knew that we were destined to explode 
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage 
You know I'm never gonna let you go 
We're like a time bomb 
Gonna lose it 
Let's diffuse it 
Baby, we're like a time bomb 
But I need it 
Wouldn't have it any other way 

Well, there's no way out of this, so let's stay in 
Every storm that comes also comes to an end 
Oh, resistance is useless 
Just two kids stupid and fearless 
Like a bullet shooting the lovesick 
There's only one way down this road 

It was like a time bomb set into motion 
We knew that we were destined to explode 
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage 
You know I'm never gonna let you go 
We're like a time bomb 
Gonna lose it 
Let's diffuse it 
Baby, we're like a time bomb 
But I need it 
Wouldn't have it any other way 

Got my heart in your hands 
Like a time bomb ticking 
It goes off; we start again 
When it breaks, we fix it 
Got your heart in my hands 
Like a time bomb ticking 
We should know better 
But we won't let go 

It was like a time bomb set into motion 
We knew that we were destined to explode 
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage 
You know I'm never gonna let you let me go 
We're like a time bomb 
Gonna lose it 
Let's diffuse it 
Baby, we're like a time bomb 
But I need it 
Wouldn't have it any other way
