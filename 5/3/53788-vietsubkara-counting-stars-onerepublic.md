Lyrics:




	
		
		Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
 Dreaming about the things that we could be
 But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
 Sitting, no more counting dollars
 We'll be counting stars, yeah we'll be counting stars

 I see this life like a swinging vine
 Swing my heart across the line
 And my face is flashing signs
 Seek it out and you shall find
 Oh, but I'm not that old
 Young, but I'm not that bold
 I don't think the world is sold
 I'm just doing what we're told
 I feel something so right
 Doing the wrong thing
 I feel something so wrong
 Doing the right thing
 I could lie, could lie, could lie
 Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

 Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
 Dreaming about the things that we could be
 But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
 Sitting, no more counting dollars
 We'll be counting stars

 Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
 Dreaming about the things that we could be
 But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
 Sitting, no more counting dollars
 We'll be, we'll be counting stars

 I feel the love and I feel it burn
 Down this river, every turn
 Hope is a four-letter word
 Make that money, watch it burn
 Oh, but I'm not that old
 Young, but I'm not that bold
 I don't think the world is sold
 I'm just doing what we're told
 I feel something so wrong
 Doing the right thing
 I could lie, could lie, could lie
 Everything that downs me makes me wanna fly

 Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
 Dreaming about the things that we could be
 But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
 Sitting, no more counting dollars
 We'll be counting stars

 Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
 Dreaming about the things that we could be
 But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
 Sitting, no more counting dollars
 We'll be, we'll be counting stars

 Take that money
 Watch it burn
 Sing in the river
 The lessons are learnt

 Take that money
 Watch it burn
 Sing in the river
 The lessons are learnt

 Take that money
 Watch it burn
 Sing in the river
 The lessons are learnt

 Take that money
 Watch it burn
 Sing in the river
 The lessons are learnt

 Everything that kills me makes feel alive

 Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
 Dreaming about the things that we could be
 But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
 Sitting, no more counting dollars
 We'll be counting stars

 Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
 Dreaming about the things that we could be
 But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
 Sitting, no more counting dollars
 We'll be, we'll be, counting stars

 Take that money
 Watch it burn
 Sing in the river
 The lessons are learnt

 Take that money
 Watch it burn
 Sing in the river
 The lessons are learnt

 Take that money
 Watch it burn
 Sing in the river
 The lessons are learnt

 Take that money
 Watch it burn
 Sing in the river
 The lessons are learnt
