​ ​ ​Lyrics: ​ ​I've been letting you down, down
Girl, I know I've been such a fool
Giving in to temptation
I should've played it cool​The situation got out of hand
I hope you understand​It can happen to anyone of us
Anyone you think of
Anyone can fall
Anyone can hurt someone they love
Hearts will break
'Cos I made a stupid mistake​It can happen to anyone of us
Say you will forgive me
Anyone can fail
Say you will believe me
I can't take, my heart will break
'Cos I made a stupid mistake, a stupid mistake​She was kind of exciting
A little crazy, I should've known
She must have altered my senses
'Cos I offered to walk her home​The situation got out of hand
I hope you understand​It can happen to anyone of us
Anyone you think of
Anyone can fall
Anyone can hurt someone they love
Hearts will break
'Cos I made a stupid mistake​It can happen to anyone of us
Say you will forgive me
Anyone can fail
Say you will believe me
I can't take, my heart will break
'Cos I made a stupid mistake, a stupid mistake​A stupid mistake
She means nothing to me, nothing to me
I swear every word is true
Don't wanna lose you​The situation got out of hand
I hope you understand​It can happen to anyone of us
Anyone you think of
Anyone can fall
Anyone can hurt someone they love
Oo, their hearts will break
'Cos I made a stupid mistake​It can happen to anyone of us
Say you will forgive me
Anyone can fail
Say you will believe me
I can't take, my heart will break
'Cos I made a stupid mistake​Anyone can fall
Anyone can hurt someone they love
Ooh, their hearts will break
'Cos I made a stupid mistake, a stupid mistake... ​ ​ ​ ​
