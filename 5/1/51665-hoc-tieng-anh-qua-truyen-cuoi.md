Gifts for mother​
 ​Three sons left home, went out on their own and prospered. They discussed the gifts they were able to give their elderly mother.​ ​The first son said: “I built a big house for our mother”​ ​The second son said: “I sent Mom a Mercedes with a driver”.​ ​The third son said: “You remember how our mother enjoys reading the Bible. Now she can’t see very well. So I sent her a remarkable parrot that recites the entire Bible. The Elders at the church spent twelve years to teach him. Mama just has to name the chapter and the verse and the parrot recites it”.​ ​Soon thereafter, their mother sent out her letters of thanks.​ ​“William,” she wrote, “the house you built is so huge. I live in only one room, but I have to clean the whole house”.​ ​“Arnold, she said, “I am too old to travel. I stay most of the time at home so I rarely use the Mercedes. That driver is so rude, he is a pain!”​ ​“But David,” she said, “the chicken was delicious”​
