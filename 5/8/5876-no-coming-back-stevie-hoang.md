My love, My trust
I gave you everything
My heart, My soul
And every part of me
But you left
And chose to be with him
Now you wanna
Come back in my life

(Tell me why should I)
Believe a word you said
(All the tears you cry)
I've fallen, much too late
(There's no reason why)
I go through that again
So go turn araound
Turn around cuz

There's no coming back (back) [x6]
Your no longer mine
There's no coming back
This time
Nooo oh oh [x3]
There's no coming back
This time

My dream, My fears
My insanity
My pride, My tears
You took it all from me
Girl you can say
All your apologies
Cuz your not
Coming back this time

(Tell me why should I)
Believe a word you said
(All the tears you cry)
I've fallen, much too late
(There's no reason why)
I go through that again
So go turn araound
Turn around

There's no coming back (back) [x6]
Your no longer mine
There's no coming back
This time

Thought the grass
Would be greener
Then what you'll
Ever have baby
Now you think that
You can just come back
Girl you must be
Thinking I'm crazy
Tell your friends that
They can stop calling
Cuz I had
Enough of it baby
If you think that
You can just come back
Girl you must be
Thinking I'm crazy

There's no coming back (back) [x6]
Your no longer mine
There's no coming back
This time
Nooo oh oh [x3]
There's no coming back
This time
